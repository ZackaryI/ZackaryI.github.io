						<h1>Idle Survivor</h1>
						<p>
						Idle Survivor is a personal project that I have been working on since I had free time while in college. While the project is not done at the moment. Currently, it's almost done, 
						it needs a few bug fixes and art assets. The premise of the game is to keep people alive by allocating survivors to tasks such as growing food and making tools. There are also seasons
						 in the game! One issue that I ran into when developing the game was that I did not plan out the code as much as I should have.

						<h1>Incursion</h1>
						<p>
							Incursion is a tower defense game that I have been working on with one another throughout my college career. Currently, as it stands all game mechanics are present in the game and we are mainly 
							waiting on a few more maps to be finished before we consider the game complete. This was my biggest project and I learned a lot from it. There are a few things I wish I did differently such as 
							documenting my code to help me keep track of what does what. this would help with debugging a lot.
